# Archive - Classic RL Resources

This directory contains foundational Reinforcement Learning materials from 2017, including course notes and fundamental concepts.

## Contents

### [2017 Course Notes](./2017-Course-Notes/)

#### [CS294 Deep RL (Berkeley Spring 2017)](./2017-Course-Notes/CS294-DeepRL-Berkeley/)
Personal notes from the legendary CS 294 course taught by:
- Sergey Levine
- John Schulman
- Chelsea Finn

**Topics Covered**:
- Imitation Learning (DAgger)
- Optimal Control and Trajectory Optimization
- Learning Dynamical System Models
- Policy Gradients
- Trust Region Methods (TRPO)
- Actor-Critic Methods
- Model-Based RL

**Historical Context**: This course was taught during a pivotal time in Deep RL, right after major breakthroughs like:
- AlphaGo (2016)
- Atari DQN (2015)
- Continuous control with deep RL (DDPG, 2016)

#### [Elements of RL](./2017-Course-Notes/Elements-Of-RL/)
Fundamental concepts derived from Sutton & Barto (2017):
- Policies
- Reward signals
- Value functions
- Environment models
- Planning and Exploration

## Why Archive These?

While these resources are from 2017, they remain **highly valuable** for understanding:

1. **Foundational Concepts**: Core RL algorithms haven't changed
2. **Historical Context**: Understanding how we got to modern methods
3. **Mathematical Foundations**: The theory is still relevant
4. **Learning Path**: Great for beginners before diving into modern applications

## Modern Equivalents

If you're looking for updated versions of these resources:

- **CS294 → CS285**: Berkeley continues to offer an updated version at [rail.eecs.berkeley.edu](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)
- **Classic algorithms** are still taught, but with modern implementations and tooling
- New topics added: RLHF, LLM alignment, model-based RL advances

---

## Recommended Learning Path

1. **Start here** if you're new to RL
2. Work through the CS294 notes systematically
3. Implement classic algorithms (DQN, A3C, PPO)
4. Then move to [Modern RL Research](../Modern-RL-Research/) for cutting-edge applications
